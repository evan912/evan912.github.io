I am a Data Scientist at OneAnalytix, Singapore. I finished my Ph.D. on information engineer from School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My current work and research areas includes Big Data Analysis (Hadoop and spark), Machine/Deep Learning, Recommendation System, Human Computer Interaction.



**Interests:**

Data science, machine learning, deep learning, and blockchain.

Big data analysis, Hadoop, Spark, Drill, Linux / Unix. 

Brain-computer interaction, graphic/haptic rendering, virtual reality.



## Experience:

### [from 2018] AVP, Data Scientist, OCBC 

### [2016-2018] Data Scientist, OneAnalytix
Recommendation System based on Transaction Analytics
* Understanding customers from their shopping consumption habits.
* Build different recommendation models for financial industries.
* Develop analytics system for big data processing based on Hadoop, spark and
apache drill.


### [2014-2016] Research Fellow, Fraunhofer Singapore 
CAAS Project: Integrated System for the Future Air Traffic Management Workplace and Human Factors Evaluations in Future Air Traffic Control 
* Development of a future workplace for air traffic controllers.
* Developed machine learning models for various brain states recognition and real-
time brain states monitoring tools.
* Achieve three levels of stress recognition with the accuracy of 75.22%, and two
levels of stress can be recognized with the accuracy of 85.17%.
* Implemented statistical analysis to prove the significant human factors in air traffic
control.

Integrated System for the Future Air Traffic Management Workplace and Human Factors Evaluations:
* Analysis air traffic controllers mental workload and stress in different traffic situations based on EEG data.
* Use machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to compare results of mental workload.
* Develop real-time visualisation system for mental stress, workload and emotion based on EEG data.
